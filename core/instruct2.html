<p>In the following tasks, you will be presented with a series of words or images to classify into groups. These tasks require classifying items as quickly as you can while making as few mistakes as possible.  Going too slowly or making too many mistakes will result in an uninterpretable score.  The following is a list of category labels and the items that belong to each of those categories.</p>

<table>
    <tr><td><strong>Category</strong></td><td><strong>Items</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td id="clabel1"></td><td id="citems1"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabel2"></td><td id="citems2"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelA"></td><td id="citemsA"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelB"></td><td id="citemsB"></td>
</table>


<p>Please keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your index fingers on the 'E' and 'I' keys to enable rapid response.</li>
    <li>Two labels at the top will tell you which words or images go with each key.</li>
    <li>Each word or image has a correct classification. Most of these are easy.</li>
    <li>The test gives no results if you go slow -- Please try to go as fast as possible.</li>
    <li>Expect to make a few mistakes because of going fast.  That's OK.</li>
    <li>For best results, make sure that your monitor is set to maximum brightness and avoid distractions.</li>
</ul>
